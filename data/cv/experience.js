    <p>
      Big chunk of work was creating and managing procedures and functions in <strong>MySQL</strong>
      (working with json, aggregation, transactions, generating statuses and error messages)
      for rest api endpoints. Also generating <strong>swagger</strong> documentation.
      As a backend language <strong>Node.js</strong> was used.
    </p>
    <p>
      For most of the projects <strong>Bitbucket</strong> and <strong>Jira</strong> was used to track them.<br>
      All of them were deployed on company servers (they have their own data center).

    <h4>Socket.io project.</h4>
    <p>
      Sending real time data from database to frontend.
      Additionally authentication process with existing php api was implemented.
      Also json structure had to be changed.
    </p>
    <p>Tech Stack: <strong>Node.js, Socket.io, MySQL, Redis</strong></p>

    <h4>Fax project.</h4>
    <p>
      User sends an email and this email is converted to tiff file and send to real fax.
      After that user receives confirmation email back.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a work with <strong>googleScript</strong> (to get data form gmail inbox),
      <strong>googleAPI</strong> to download message attachments and message content, then files were checked viruses.
      After that <strong>FreeSwitch</strong> was used to send actual fax.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see this process has a lot of steps and takes some time.
      So multiple workers had to be done and managed
      (MessageSyncWorker, DownloaderWorker, FaxSenderWorker, EmailConfirmationWorker)

    <h4>SoundFile mini project</h4>
    <p>
      User sends sound file he can record in vue app or choose on his system.
      After that this file had to be checked for viruses,
      and be converted to mp3 and ulaw and to 8 bit with bitrate of 8kbps and 1 channel
      (to reduce file size)
    </p>
    <p>Tech Stack: <strong>Node.js, MySQL, ClamAV, SoX</strong></p>

    <h4>React Cli</h4>
    <p>Create-react-app is not good enough for me. But configuring webpack every single time is a pain.</p>
    <p>So I decided to cerate my own npm package to suffice my needs</p>
    <p>I was inspired by vue cli so I implemented a similar solution</p>

    <h4>Store</h4>
    <p>
      I've used redux for some time in react apps. It's good enough but it requires some boilerplate.
      Main issue is a need to implement the reducers, which are useless in my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>This library fixes this issue. It's very minimalistic and easy to use. No setup is required.</p>
